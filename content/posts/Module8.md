**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I learned further about comparing one CMS to another while also learning some of the difficulties involved in that process.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** I feel more confident in my ability to research and compare CMSs and determine whether they fit my needs. However, I now understand that in a large company setting it would be a very big process that would require a lot of deliberation.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** This week my group and I have continued using the workflow we established and it is working well. I'm also getting much more comfortable with making the weekly Hugo blog posts and have a set order in which I do things for this task.

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github, and I can now use a little bit of WordPress. I also learned about a new CMS called Magento this week.

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.** I've begun looking into new CMSs and am starting to see the complexities of comparing one to another and determining which is best to use for my needs.
