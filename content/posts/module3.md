**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I became more familiar with the process of creating workflows which is a key concept to learn for successfully managing web content.  

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** We haven't yet discussed enough content management systems for me to be able to compare them.  

**I can manage content using established workflows.** Now that we have more discussed workflows in depth and I've learned how to create my own workflows I can now manage content using my established workflows.  

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github.  

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.** This week I refreshed my memory on markdown because I had forgotten some of the syntax of the language I had learned last week.
