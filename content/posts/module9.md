**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I learned more about how to effectively define presentation since that is what I did a lot of writing about. I also learned how to explain HTML in a way that would be useful for a person that is new to the language.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** I feel more confident in my ability to research and compare CMSs and determine whether they fit my needs. However, I now understand that in a large company setting it would be a very big process that would require a lot of deliberation.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** This week really tested the effectiveness of my group's established workflow. We did the work efficiently and we worked well together but we definitely had to make some changes to our workflow to allow for working on multiple projects simultaneously as well as to work around everybody's varied schedules.

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github, and I can now use a little bit of WordPress. I also learned about a new CMS called Magento this week.

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**  This week I looked at how other people describe basic HTML in order to describe it myself in a way that makes sense for both me and my reader.
