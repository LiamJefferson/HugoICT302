**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I began learning how to compare one CMS to another to determine which service would work best for me.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** This week I began to learn various ways to compare one CMS to another from Baker's guidelines.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** This week my group and I have continued using the workflow we established and it is working well. I'm also getting much more comfortable with making the weekly Hugo blog posts and have a set order in which I do things for this task.

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github, and I can now use a little bit of WordPress.  

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.** This week I looked a bit more into WordPress to get more of an understanding of how to work with the more intricate parts of the CMS.
