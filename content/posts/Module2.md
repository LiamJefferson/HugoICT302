I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management : This week I learned Markdown syntax which I was unfamiliar with before. Markdown is useful for making web content look nicer.
I can describe and compare content management systems : We haven't done anything related to this point this week.
I can manage content using established workflows : I can manage my Hugo website through my Github repository and I've gotten more familiar with that repository. 
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management : I am now more knowledgeable about markdown and can employ that when needed.
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning : I learned about W3schools which is a helpful site for information about HTML and CSS.
