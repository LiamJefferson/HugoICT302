**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I became more familiar with what defines a CMS and how to compare a "simple" CMS to an "advanced" CMS.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** I haven't yet worked with other CMS to be able to compare Hugo to others but I now understand what features some CMS have that others don't.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** Now that we have more discussed workflows in depth and I've learned how to create my own workflows I can now manage content using my established workflows.  

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github.  

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.** This week I refreshed my memory on markdown because I had forgotten some of the syntax of the language I had learned last week.
