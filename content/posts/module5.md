**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I learned the difference between content and presentation and discovered the power of CSS that I hadn't known about before.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** I haven't yet worked with other CMS to be able to compare Hugo to others but I now understand what features some CMS have that others don't.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** Now that we have more discussed workflows in depth and I've learned how to create my own workflows I can now manage content using my established workflows.  

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github.  

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.** This week I looked a bit into CSS after discovering how powerful it is from the CSS Zen Garden activity.
