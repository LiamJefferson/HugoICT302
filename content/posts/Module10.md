**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I learned about content modeling and the basics of how it is done and why it is an important step in creating a website.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** I feel more confident in my ability to research and compare CMSs and determine whether they fit my needs. However, I now understand that in a large company setting it would be a very big process that would require a lot of deliberation.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** I feel confident in my own and my group's established workflows. Each week things have been going more and more smoothly.

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github, and I can now use a little bit of WordPress.

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**  This week I did a little research on all the various types of datatypes that can be used in content modeling.
