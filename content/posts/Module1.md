I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - I'm not yet able to identify key concepts but I now have more hands-on experience with content management systems.
I can describe and compare content management systems. - So far we have only worked with one content management system so I'm not yet able to accurately compare them.
I can manage content using established workflows. - I've learned how to work with a GitHub repository to manage the content in my Hugo site, but I've not yet established a workflow which will come with more experience.
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - I can make use of Hugo websites.
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. - We've not made it to this stage in the course.
