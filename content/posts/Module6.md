**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I began learning the differences that differnt content management services have to offer.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** This week I began getting an understanding of WordPress and am now starting to see how WordPress works differently to Hugo.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** This week I used the workflow that myself and my group established for the first time and it worked very well.

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github, and I can now use a little bit of WordPress.  

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.** This week I looked a bit into WordPress to get a basic understanding of how to work with this new CMS.
