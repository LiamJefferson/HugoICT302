**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.** This week I learned more about the types of features that can be added by implementing plugins to a CMS.

**I can describe and compare content management systems.** I feel more confident in my ability to research and compare CMSs and determine whether they fit my needs. The more we learn about CMSs the more I realize how nuanced this decision would be.

**I can manage content using established workflows.** I feel confident in my own and my group's established workflows. Each week things have been going more and more smoothly.

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.** I can use the technologies we have previously discussed such as Hugo and Github, and I can now use a little bit of WordPress. I now also know how to search for and implement plugins to WordPress.

**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**  This week I looked at some articles about what some people consider to be the most useful WordPress plugins and why they think those plugins are worth adding to your WordPress site.
